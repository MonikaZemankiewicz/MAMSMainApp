Its construction was begun in 955 by Abderram√°n III and finished by Hayr√°n, taifa king of Almeria, in the XI century. After the Christian conquest it was reformed by the Catholic Monarchs and Carlos I. It has three walled enclosures. One of the three was built by the Catholic Monarchs. It was a royal residence and today stands at the foot of Al-Mutasin palace with all its rooms, its mosque, converted into a church since the end of the XV century, and its baths. It has only one entrance, made almost invisible by the enormous walls as well as large rooms with vaulted ceilings and gothic doors. From the top of the castle walls we can enjoy marvellous views of the city and the port.",

Spain's southeast coast, where the park is situated, is the only region in mainland Europe with a true hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: BWh). The eponymous mountain range of the Sierra del Cabo de Gata, with its highest peak El Fraile, form a volcanic rock formation with sharp peaks and crags in red and ochre hues. It falls steeply to the Mediterranean Sea, creating jagged 100-metre (330 ft) high cliffs riven by gullies, creating hidden coves and white, sandy beaches. Offshore are numerous tiny rocky islands and extensive coral reefs teeming with marine life.[2] Its climate is dry, with rainfall below 160 mm (6.3 in) a year and average yearly temperatures above 19 ¬∞C (66 ¬∞F). In 1997, it was designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. In 2001, it was included among the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance, due to the adsorptive properties and low permeability of its clays, the area was studied as a possible place for deep storage of sealed radioactive waste.",
